# TalysLib
This library requires ROOT6 (https://root.cern/) and TALYS 1.8 or 1.9 (https://tendl.web.psi.ch/tendl_2019/talys.html)
Compilation: make
Variable TALYSDIR=PATH_TO_TALYS_DIRECTORY should be defined in .bashrc; Path to Talys executable file should be written in PATH variable.
A modified talys.setup macro could be used for Talys installation to assign these variables automatically
